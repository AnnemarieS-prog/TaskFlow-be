# Task Flow
## The vision
TaskFlow is a flexible task management app that adapts to your workflow. Choose between strict scheduling (e.g. "every 2 weeks on Sunday") or adaptable, "flowy" rescheduling, which adjusts based on when a task was last completed. Stay organized without micromanaging every detail.
